            The document prepared by Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), provides such
            recommendations in identified domains of innovation and technology development, technology
            adoption/diffusion, boosting up manufacturing and productivity, trade and globalization, internet policy and
            data management & education and training.

            “Suggestions given by TIFAC are very comprehensive and come from all the stakeholders. It adds value to the

            whole world in all parameters. When we started the year 2020, we had a lot of things that we wanted to
            achieve. But at the end of this year, we have overcome most of the problems, and science, technology, and
            innovation has played a great role in it,” he added.
