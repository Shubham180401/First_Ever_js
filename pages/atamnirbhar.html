        <p>The world’s biggest lockdown imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19 has severely impacted the domestic
            economic activities as it brought nearly 70% of economic activity, investment, exports, and discretionary
            consumption to a standstill.

            And will eventually drag down the GDP growth of the country to negative single-digit band for FY21E.

        <br>
        <p>
            So, to improve the prevailing turbulent economic environment and to provide a boost to the ailing economy
            the current government announced the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, a financial package of Rs 20 lakh crore
            equaling to 10% of the national GDP.

        <p>Government of India is taking several steps to ensure that we are well prepared to face the challenges and
            threats posed by COVID-19. With active support of citizens of India, we have been able to mitigate the
            spread of the virus so far. One of the most important factors in the fight with the virus is to empower the
            citizens with accurate information and enable them to take precautions as per the advisories being issued by
            different Ministries. The COVID-19 Inter-Ministerial Notifications website serves this purpose efficiently
            by providing COVID-19 related notifications from various Ministries in a format that is accessible, built
            using the S3WaaS framework, that is secure & scalable.

        <br>
        <p>
            India has faced the COVID-19 situation with fortitude and a spirit of self-reliance, that is evident in the
            fact that from zero production of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) before March 2020, India today has
            created a capacity of producing 2 lakh PPE kits daily, which is also growing steadily.

            Additionally, India has demonstrated how it rises up to challenges and uncovers opportunities therein, as
            manifested in the re-purposing of various automobile sector industries to collaborate in the making of
            life-saving ventilators. The clarion call given by the Hon'ble PM to use these trying times to become
            Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) has been very well received to enable the resurgence of the Indian economy.
            Unlock 1 Guidelines have been issued to enable resumption of economic activities while maintaining abundant
            caution thus allowing graded easing of restrictions.

            million MSMEs operating in the non-agricultural sector in India, and provides sustenance to a large
            proportion of the population.

            The government will offer Rs 3 lakh crore as collateral free or unsecured loan to MSMEs with an annual
            turnover of Rs 100 crore or an outstanding loan of Rs 25 crore. The loan tenure will have tenure of four
            years with a moratorium period of 12month. Additionally, Rs 20,000 crore loans will be provided to stressed
            MSMEs.

            The government has given a new definition for the MSMEs where it had done away with the distinction between
            manufacturing and service MSMEs and also increased the limit for investment in these units.

            The change in definition will allow these units to expand and at the same time avail the benefits of MSME
            classification.
